Eleanor is an atmospheric science Ph.D. Candidate with research experience in atmospheric modeling, theory, and observations. She has participated in multiple field campaigns, during which she has been an FAA-licensed unmanned aerial system (UAS) pilot and a forecast lead for forecasting both continental and tropical severe weather. Eleanor's primary research interests include exploring the relationships between the tropical cyclone boundary layer and tropical cyclone structure and intensity, but she is fascinated by all types of miso- to meso-scale phenomena. Eleanor is also motivated to improve atmospheric science education, and she has been honing her science teaching skills since she first began volunteering at a local children's science museum in 2006.
